This repository houses my personal web-dev portfolio. The site is hosted at [anthonyutt.com](https://anthonyutt.com).

## About
This site was created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). To get started with Next.js, follow the instructions below or look up the tutorial hosted [here](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).

Prerequisite: You must be running Node 10.13 (at the time of writing) or later. You can check your version using the following commands.

#### Mac

```
node -v
```

### Step 1: Create a Next.js App
Create a new app using the `create-next-app` tool.
```
npx create-next-app <app-name>
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the app folder and run the development server
You have a newly-created folder named `<app_name>`. Navigate to it:
```
cd <app_name>
```
And then run the following command to start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`
This one is pretty self-explanatory...

### Step 4: Start coding!
Next.js using hot reloading, so any time you change a file in the application directory, the page will immediately be rendered to show your changes.
